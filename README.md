Submit a link to a GitHub repo where you have made 6 different plots using at least 2 plotting packages.

Initial thoughts:

1 Chart - Pie Chart with Selection drop-down for user to select which Zip Code they want to see.
This will show the comparison between that Zip Code and all of the failed inspections. Using plotly plotting package.

1 Chart - Histogram Plot showing dates of the inspections. Using plotly plotting package.

1 Chart - Bar Chart showing if the inspections had a critical issue and count the number of Yes or No values. Using matplotlib plotting package.

1 Chart - Bar Chart showing the top 5 Zip Codes with the most failed inspections. Using matplotlib plotting package.

1 Chart - Stem Plot not sure what to show here, but using matplotlib or seaborn.

1 Chart - Scatter Plot using the Penguin info. Showing weight or height. Using matplotlib or seaborn.
