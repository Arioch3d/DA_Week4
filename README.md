Submit a link to a GitHub repo where you have made 6 different plots using at least 2 plotting packages.

Initial thoughts:

DONE - 1 Chart - Bar Chart showing if the inspections had a critical issue and count the number of Yes or No values. Using matplotlib plotting package.

DONE - 1 Chart - Pie Chart showing if the inspections had a critical issue and percentage of the number of Yes or No values. Using matplotlib plotting package.

DONE - 1 Chart - Horizontal Bar Chart Showing top 5 issues found. Using matplotlib plotting package.

DONE - 1 Chart - Bar Chart showing zip codes and allowing user to select which zip code they want to filter the results on.

1 Chart - Stem Plot showing Species for the Star Wars movies, using matplotlib or seaborn. Took some research to find the "grid" option to create the horizontal lines on that chart.

1 Chart - Scatter Plot using the Penguin info. Showing weight or height. Using matplotlib or seaborn.

1 Chart - Pie Chart with Selection drop-down for user to select which Zip Code they want to see.
This will show the comparison between that Zip Code and all of the failed inspections. Using plotly plotting package. - Still need to figure the drop down option out.

1 Chart - Histogram Plot showing dates of the inspections. Using plotly plotting package.
